            <h1>Lesson 1: Learning How to Drive</h1>
            
            <p>Welcome to <strong>MORPH's</strong> first lesson!</p>
            
            <p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to drive your robot using a keyboard (<strong>W, A, S, D</strong>) or on-screen buttons. By the end, you'll know how to make it go <strong>forward</strong>, <strong>backward</strong>, and <strong>turn</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Task 1: Meet Your Robot</h2>
            
            <p>Look at your robot for a moment.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>It has wheels on the <strong>left side</strong>.</li>
                <li>It has wheels on the <strong>right side</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Think of it like this:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>If <strong>both sides</strong> roll forward, the whole robot moves <strong>forward</strong>.</li>
                <li>If <strong>both sides</strong> roll backward, the whole robot goes <strong>backward</strong>.</li>
                <li>If <strong>one side</strong> rolls forward and the <strong>other</strong> rolls backward, the robot <strong>turns in place</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Just remember that the robot moves because its <strong>left and right wheels spin</strong>.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Task 2: Open the Driving Screen</h2>
            
            <p>On your computer, open the <strong>robot-driving app</strong> that your teacher showed you.</p>
            
            <p>You should see:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Buttons or arrows that say <strong>Up, Down, Left, Right,</strong> and <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
                <li>A place that shows if the robot is <strong>connected</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Ask your teacher to make sure the robot is connected and ready.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Task 3: Learn the Driving Keys (W, A, S, D)</h2>
            
            <p>Now look at the keyboard. Find these letters:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>W</strong></li>
                <li><strong>A</strong></li>
                <li><strong>S</strong></li>
                <li><strong>D</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For this robot, they mean:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>W</strong> → go <strong>forward</strong></li>
                <li><strong>S</strong> → go <strong>backward</strong></li>
                <li><strong>A</strong> → turn <strong>left</strong></li>
                <li><strong>D</strong> → turn <strong>right</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Space bar</strong> → <strong>stop</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You can think:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>"<strong>W</strong> means both wheels forward."</li>
                <li>"<strong>S</strong> means both wheels backward."</li>
                <li>"<strong>A</strong> means turn left."</li>
                <li>"<strong>D</strong> means turn right."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Task 4: Drive with the Buttons</h2>
            
            <p>Let's practice using the buttons first.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Press the <strong>Up / W</strong> button.<br><br>
                    Watch your robot. What happens to its wheels?<br><br>
                    You should see <strong>both sides</strong> of the robot move forward. The robot goes <strong>forward</strong>.</li>
                
                <li>Press the <strong>Down / S</strong> button.<br><br>
                    Now, both sides move <strong>backward</strong>, and the robot goes <strong>backward</strong>.</li>
                
                <li>Press the <strong>Left / A</strong> button.<br><br>
                    The <strong>right wheels</strong> move forward, and the <strong>left wheels</strong> move backward; the robot <strong>turns left</strong>.</li>
                
                <li>Press the <strong>Right / D</strong> button.<br><br>
                    The <strong>left wheels</strong> move forward, and the <strong>right wheels</strong> move backward; the robot <strong>turns right</strong>.</li>
                
                <li>Press <strong>Stop / Space bar</strong>.<br><br>
                    The robot should <strong>stop moving</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Try that a few times. Note what you think will happen when you press each button, and predict how you might navigate to somewhere in the room with a combination of the buttons.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>"I want to go to the door in the corner of the room, so I'll move forward, turn right, and move forward again."</li>
                <li>"I want my robot to look out the window. I'll move back from my current spot, turn right, and move forward to the window."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Task 5: Try It With Your Own Task!</h2>
            
            <p>Now try driving the robot with the keyboard and each new button:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Find somewhere in the room where you want to move your robot. It's probably going to take a few moving steps to get to your destination.</li>
                
                <li>What is a <strong>sequence of steps</strong> that you can take to move to that spot? Should you move <strong>forward, left, right,</strong> or <strong>backward</strong>, and in what order?</li>
                
                <li>Write down your <strong>prediction</strong> of the steps to make the robot move to your destination.</li>
                
                <li>With your teacher's permission, try following those steps with <strong>WASD</strong> controls and see if you can end up at that spot.</li>
                
                <li>After arriving at your destination, note if the commands you planned on running got you to where you wanted to go, or if you had to change some things around.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>If you can do this and explain what the robot's wheels are doing, you've passed <strong>Lesson 1: Learning How to Drive!</strong></p>
