# **MORPH**
## A learning robot kit.

## Quick Start (Desktop App Only)
1. **Clone the repo and move into the desktop app**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oss-slu/MORPH.git
   cd SmartRobot/desktop
   ```

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Socket.IO-enabled Flask server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Connect to your robot (optional)**
   - In the dashboard’s “Connection” card, keep the default IP or type your robot’s IP.
   - Click **Connect**. Once the status badge flips to “Connected” you can drive, monitor telemetry, and view logs.

> ROS 2 builds are only needed if you plan to run the robot stack locally. For UI-only testing, the steps above are sufficient.
